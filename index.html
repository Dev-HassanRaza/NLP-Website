          Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program
          to understand human language as it is spoken and written referred to
          as natural language. It is a component of artificial intelligence
          (AI).
          <br />
          <br />
          NLP has existed for more than 50 years and has roots in the field of
          linguistics. It has a variety of real-world applications in a number
          of fields, including medical research, search engines and business
          intelligence.

        <h3>How Does Natural Language Processing Works?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="npara">
        <p>
          NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do.
          Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing
          uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and
          make sense of it in a way a computer can understand. Just as humans
          have different sensors such as ears to hear and eyes to see computers
          have programs to read and microphones to collect audio. And just as
          humans have a brain to process that input, computers have a program to
          process their respective inputs. At some point in processing, the
          input is converted to code that the computer can understand. <br />
          <br />
          There are two main phases to natural language processing: data
          preprocessing and algorithm development. Data preprocessing involves
          preparing and "cleaning" text data for machines to be able to analyze
          it. <br />
          preprocessing puts data in workable form and highlights features in
          the text that an algorithm can work with. There are several ways this
          can be done
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ques">
        <h3>Why Is Natural Language Processing Important?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="paragra">
        <p>
          Businesses use massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data and
          need a way to efficiently process it. A lot of the information created
          online and stored in databases is natural human language, and until
          recently, businesses could not effectively analyze this data. This is
          where natural language processing is useful. <br />
          <br />
          The advantage of natural language processing can be seen when
          considering the following two statements: "Cloud computing insurance
          should be part of every service-level agreement," and, "A good SLA
          ensures an easier night's sleep even in the cloud." If a user relies
          on natural language processing for search, the program will recognize
          that cloud computing is an entity, that cloud is an abbreviated form
          of cloud computing and that SLA is an industry acronym for
          service-level agreement.
        </p>

        <h3>What is natural language processing used for?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="paranp">
        <p>
          This involves assigning tags to texts to put them in categories. This
          can be useful for sentiment analysis, which helps the natural language
          processing algorithm determine the sentiment, or emotion behind a
          text. For example, when brand A is mentioned in X number of texts, the
          algorithm can determine how many of those mentions were positive and
          how many were negative. It can also be useful for intent detection,
          which helps predict what the speaker or writer may do based on the
          text they are producing. <br />
          <br />
          One example of this is keyword extraction, which pulls the most
          important words from the text, which can be useful for search engine
          optimization. Doing this with natural language processing requires
          some programming -- it is not completely automated. However, there are
          plenty of simple keyword extraction tools that automate most of the
          process -- the user just has to set parameters within the program. For
          example, a tool might pull out the most frequently used words in the
          text. Another example is named entity recognition, which extracts the
          names of people, places and other entities from text. <br />
          <br />
          Research being done on natural language processing revolves around
          search, especially Enterprise search. This involves having users query
          data sets in the form of a question that they might pose to another
          person. The machine interprets the important elements of the human
          language sentence, which correspond to specific features in a data
          set, and returns an answer. <br />
          <br />
          NLP can be used to interpret free, unstructured text and make it
          analyzable. There is a tremendous amount of information stored in free
          text files, such as patients' medical records. Before deep
          learning-based NLP models, this information was inaccessible to
          computer-assisted analysis and could not be analyzed in any systematic
          way. With NLP analysts can sift through massive amounts of free text
          to find relevant information. <br />
          <br />
          Sentiment analysis is another primary use case for NLP. Using
          sentiment analysis, data scientists can assess comments on social
          media to see how their business's brand is performing, or review notes
          from customer service teams to identify areas where people want the
          business to perform better.
